python -c "from database import init_db; init_db()"

# This command initializes the database by running the init_db function from the database module.
venv\Scripts\activate
# This command activates the virtual environment, allowing you to run Python scripts and commands within that environment.
uvicorn main:app --reload
# This command starts the FastAPI application using Uvicorn, with auto-reload enabled for development.
# The app is defined in the main module (main.py) and the --reload flag allows for automatic reloading of the server when code changes are detected.
# This is useful for development purposes, as it allows you to see changes without manually restarting the server.
